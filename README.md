The ADS-B receiver server component for the [**MyPreflight**][homepage] platform. It listens for position reports over
HTTP, from flight-simulator-based transponders.

</div>

## About

**MyPreflight** is a briefing service and electronic flight board app for your virtual flights, providing you realistic
figures, checklists, procedures and data to perform your flight like a real pilots do. You can customize your
experience, integrate with SimBrief and other tools. Check out our homepage at [mypreflight.io][homepage].

**This module** is the ground station. Real ADS-B receiver listens to 1090 MHz, and this one listens to HTTP:

- accepts position reports from the [transponder app][transponder-repo] running on a player's PC,
- keeps the track of every callsign in memory, ordered by time,
- serves that track to anything that wants to process these data.

It is as close as it gets **ADS-B over HTTP** implementation.

### Built with

[![TypeScript][ts-badge]][ts-url]
[![Node.js][node-shield]][node-url]
[![NestJS][nest-badge]][nest-url]
[![Docker][docker-badge]][docker-url]

No database. Positions live in a `cache-manager` store keyed by callsign, so the receiver restarts empty — exactly like
a real one does when you power-cycle it.

## Getting started

### Environment

This app uses docker-based virtualization to run. To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project by running:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:oskarbarcz/adsb-receiver-api.git
    ```

2. Prepare an environment variable file by copying `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill it with your data.

    ```shell
    cd adsb-receiver-api
    cp .env.dist .env
    ```

3. Use docker compose to set up the environment

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

    Packages and dependencies will be configured automatically.

4. Your project should be up and running. Open the browser and go to [http://localhost/api](http://localhost/api) to see
   the api documentation. You can preview app logs by running:

    ```shell
    docker compose logs -f app
    ```

> **Do not execute NPM or any other commands regarding project from your host machine, use container shell instead.**
> For example, to lint the project run:
>
> ```shell
> docker compose exec app npm run lint
> ```

To shut the containers down run:

```shell
docker compose down
```

### Authorization

There are two bearer tokens, both set in `.env`. There are no user accounts and nothing is persisted.

| Token          | Who holds it        | What it unlocks                        |
| -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `CLIENT_TOKEN` | the transponder app | publishing position reports            |
| `ADMIN_TOKEN`  | the platform        | clearing the track of a given callsign |

Reading a track needs no token at all — a real ADS-B signal is not authenticated either.

## Usage

The full endpoint reference is generated from the code and published at [adsb.mypreflight.io][docs-url].

A position report carries the fields a Mode S transponder would broadcast:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/v1/position \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer client-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "callsign": "DLH1234",
    "date": "2025-08-08T15:46:38.250Z",
    "latitude": 51.47115,
    "longitude": -0.47351,
    "altitude": 91.95,
    "verticalRate": 0,
    "squawk": "6222",
    "groundSpeed": 0.32,
    "track": 179.07,
    "alert": false,
    "emergency": false,
    "spi": false,
    "isOnGround": true
  }'
```

Every field is required and the payload is validated on the way in: latitude and longitude have to be on the globe, and
`squawk` has to be four octal digits — `7700` is a valid emergency code, `7800` is not a code at all. Unknown
properties are rejected outright, so a malformed report gets a `400` instead of being silently trimmed.

Reports accumulate per callsign rather than overwriting, so `GET /api/v1/position/DLH1234` returns the whole track in
chronological order. An unknown callsign returns an empty array, not a `404`.

## Testing

To run tests, execute the following commands:

```bash
# unit tests
$ docker compose exec app npm run test

# functional tests
$ docker compose exec app npm run test:functional
```

We use **Jest** for unit tests, and **cucumber-js** for functional tests. Unit tests are stored in the `src` directory
just near the tested module, while functional tests are stored in the `features` directory.

## Build, test and deploy

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Continuous integration and deployment run on GitHub Actions, configured in the `.github/workflows` directory. Every pull
request is audited, formatted, linted and tested; every merge to `main` tags the repository, cuts a release and pushes
the production image to `ghcr.io`.
